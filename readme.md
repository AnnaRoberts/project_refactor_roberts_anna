#Comments:
* The commit 95db23a is extremely long because I was using it to reference back in case I deleted something I shouldn't have. We talked about this on Thursday night and I will now use the wonderful tool of tags from here on out. 
* The commit ddb9d79 has two separate topics in one commit. This was an accicent, we also talked about this on Thursday. I now know not to do that, as it is not ideal for commits. They should be one logical action, not two unrelated ones. 
* When you shrink the size of the screen down to 1111px my sidebar disappears. I'm not sure why I have taken out every margin, padding, height, I could find. The sidebar appears to not be listening to the media query. If you could take a look and give me any feedback you can on how to fix this, that would be great! 
* I used the visually hidden code from BoilerPlate as stated in my resources. This was to help with the structuring for both HTML 4 and 5. 
* I added the wrong readme file so I had to push branch twice.
